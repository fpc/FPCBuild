FPC demo package
================
This packages contains the following subdirectories:

- text     text mode demos (should run everywhere)
- graph    demos which use the graph unit (runs nearly everywhere)
           includes gameunit (text&graph), outputs to another subdir level
- modex    demos which make extensive use of modeX (runs with go32v2 only)
- win32    demos which are win32 specific
- linux    demos which are linux specific
- lister   KVM api demo. Runs on Unix, win32 and OS/2 currently.
- os2      demos which are OS/2 specific
- palmos   demos which are palmos specific (dragonball)
- netware  demos which are netware(clib) specific
- netwlibc demos which are netware(libc) specific
- macos    demos which are macos (classic) specific
- freebsd  demos which are freebsd specific
- morphos  demos which are morphos specific
- wince    demos which are wince specific

To build the programs (except for macos and wince) simply type 'make' in
the base dir. To do a cross build, type make OS_TARGET=crosstarget, i.e.
make OS_TARGET=win32. This assumes the crossbinutils and cross RTL are
properly installed and configured.

To build the macos sample, issue the command 'fpc <filename>' in MPW in
directory macos.

If you want to add further samples, edit Makefile.fpc and rebuild the real
Makefile by entering 'fpcmake -T all'. This is a special fpc generic utility
to simplify platform independent makefile generation for the user.
