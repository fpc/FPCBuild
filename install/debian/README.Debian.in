The Free Pascal Compiler for Debian
- -----------------------------------

Only PDF docs are built as shipped. You may want to make the HTML files with
tex4ht by yourself and eventually adapt the doc-base file.

To create a new config file for fpc (/etc/fpc.cfg) use the command:
 /usr/lib/fpc/%{fpcversion}/samplecfg /usr/lib/fpc/%{fpcversion}
However, you should be aware that said file (/etc/fpc.cfg) is
declared as a conffile since version 1.0.2.

And, yes - this is a i386/amd64/powerpc/sparc/arm only package currently.

Debugging support
-------------------------------------

As discussed in bug 528855 [1], fp-ide currently does not have debugging
support. We are still trying to define a proper solution, but for now it
just doesn't work.
