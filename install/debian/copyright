 .
 The upstream source has been repacked to remove non-distributable files:
 fpcsrc/rtl/netwlibc/pre/libcpre.gcc.o and
 fpcsrc/packages/fcl-js/src/jsminifier.pp. Because repacking needed to be done
 anyways, also other precompiled files and generated Makefiles were removed, in
 order to save considerable amounts of disk space. The Makefiles can be
 recreated by running the make-files target in debian/rules, i.e.: $
 debian/rules make-files

Comment: The files don't mention which version of the LGPL they mean. Most
 files and copyright statements are from a time before LGPL-3 was written. The
 text mentions "Lesser General Public License" and link to the lesser license
 on the GNU website, which is now (2015.09.07) LGPL-3. Therefore I conclude it
 is LGPL-2.1+.

 The header of these files suggests that they are under a non-DFSG license,
 i.e. the Apple APSL V1.1 or V2 license or the BSD with advertizing
 clause. However, the Debian Pascal team claims that these files are merely
 interface files, only defining data types. There is no instruction code. It is
 exactly equivalent to a C header file for any library that does not include
 any function definition.
 .
 It is our understanding that this kind of interfacing file is not covered by
 intellectual property as long as the interface itself is publicly available.

 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
 3.1. Availability of Source Code.  Any Covered Software that You distribute or
 otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in
 Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the
 terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy
 of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise
 make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in
 Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code
 form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
 software exchange.
 .
 3.2. Modifications.  The Modifications that You create or to which You
 contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
 believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
 sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
 .
 3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your
 Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You
 may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
 within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive
 text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.
 .
 3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose any terms
 on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
 applicable version of this License or the recipients‚Äô rights hereunder. You
 may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
 liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However,
 you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
 Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
 warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone,
 and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
 for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
 result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
 3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the Executable
 form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the
 terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this
 License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
 and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or
 alter the recipient‚Äôs rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth
 in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form
 under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms
 which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
 Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
 and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
 such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
 .
 3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
 with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
 Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
 requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
 .
 4. Versions of the License.
 .
 4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and
 may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to
 time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as
 provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right
 to modify this License.
 .
 4.2. Effect of New Versions.  You may always continue to use, distribute or
 otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
 of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
 the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting
 it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent
 version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
 available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
 originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
 use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the
 terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license
 steward.
 .
 4.3. Modified Versions.  When You are an Initial Developer and You want to
 create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
 modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any
 references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license
 differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license
 contains terms which differ from this License.
 .
 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
 COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù BASIS, WITHOUT
 WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
 MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
 AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
 ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
 DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
 SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
 ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
 HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 6. TERMINATION.
 .
 6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
 breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
 their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
 shall survive.
 .
 6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
 actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
 Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as
 ‚ÄúParticipant‚Äù) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor
 Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
 the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any

 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
 The Covered Software is a ‚Äúcommercial item,‚Äù as that term is defined in 48
 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ‚Äúcommercial computer software‚Äù (as
 that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ¬ß 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and ‚Äúcommercial
 computer software documentation‚Äù as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered
 Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
 clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
 provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this
 License.
 .
 9. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
 This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
 hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
 provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
 enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
 specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the
 extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
 jurisdiction‚Äôs conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
 License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
 jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
 Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
 limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys‚Äô fees and expenses. The
 application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
 International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
 provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
 drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are
 responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
 regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other
 countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered
 Software.
 .
 10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
 As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
 for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
 of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
 Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
 herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
     3.1. Application of License.
     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
     Section 3.5.
 .
     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
 .
     3.3. Description of Modifications.
     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
          (a) Third Party Claims.
          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
 .
          (b) Contributor APIs.
          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
          also include this information in the LEGAL file.
 .
               (c)    Representations.
          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
          this License.
 .
     3.5. Required Notices.
     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
     terms You offer.
 .
     3.7. Larger Works.
     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
     understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
     6.1. New Versions.
     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
     will be given a distinguishing version number.
 .
     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
     Covered Code created under this License.
 .
     6.3. Derivative Works.
     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
     this License.)
 .
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8. TERMINATION.
 .
     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
     shall survive.
 .
     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
 .
     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
     the 60 day notice period specified above.
 .
     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
     Participant.
 .
     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
     license.
 .
     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
     prior to termination shall survive termination.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
     rights set forth herein.
 .
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
     License.
 .
 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
 .
 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
 .
     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
     Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
