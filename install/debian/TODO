* Text in Help window tells you to download the documentation while it is
  already packaged (in fp-docs-##). Preferably, the documentation is
  automatically found, but if not, it should mention the packaging.

* Add autopkgtest with mini programs that just require as little units as
  possible such that it can be checked that the packages work as intended and
  can be used to compile these simple programs.

* Think about how to find the proper -dev packages to recommend (or suggest)
  for the different fp-units-* packages

* fpcmake building is broken as mentioned upstream

* Check generated files with h2pas and see if we can regenerate during build
