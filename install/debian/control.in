Description: Free Pascal -- Compiler
 The Free Pascal Compiler is a Turbo Pascal 7.0 and Delphi compatible 32/64-bit
 Pascal Compiler. It comes with a fully compatible TP 7.0 runtime library.
 Some extensions are added to the language, like function overloading. Shared
 libraries can be linked and created. Basic Delphi support is already
 implemented (classes, exceptions, ansistrings). This package contains the
 command line compiler. You need at least the RTL package before you can start
 compiling anything.

 The Free Pascal Compiler is a Turbo Pascal 7.0 and Delphi compatible 32/64-bit
 Pascal Compiler. It comes with a fully compatible TP 7.0 runtime library.
 Some extensions are added to the language, like function overloading. Shared
 libraries can be linked and created. Basic Delphi support is already
 implemented (classes, exceptions, ansistrings). This package contains the
 Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The IDE has an internal compiler.
 You need at least the RTL package before you can start  compiling anything.
