Description: Free Pascal Compiler -- Meta Package
 The Free Pascal Compiler is a Turbo Pascal 7.0 and Delphi compatible 32/64-bit
 Pascal Compiler. It comes with a fully compatible TP 7.0 runtime library.
 Some extensions are added to the language, like function overloading. Shared
 libraries can be linked and created. Basic Delphi support is already
 implemented (classes, exceptions, ansistrings, open arayes). This package
 contains dependency on all FPC packages provided on your architecture. You need
 at least the RTL package before you can start compiling anything, but if you
 want to write any real-world program, you may need to install this meta
 package.
