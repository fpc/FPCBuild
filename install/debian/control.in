Description: Free Pascal Compiler - Meta Package
 The Free Pascal Compiler is an object pascal compiler supporting both Delphi
 and Turbo Pascal 7.0 dialects as well as Mac pascal dialects.
 It provides a completely portable RunTime Library (RTL) available on many
 platforms and compatible with Turbo Pascal, but also a platfrom independent
 class based Free Component Library (FCL) adding many Delphi extensions and
 interfacing many popular open source libraries.
 .
 Some extensions are added to the language, like function overloading. Shared
 libraries can be linked and created. Delphi language extentions like classes,
 exceptions, ansi strings and open arrays are also supported.
 .
 This package contains dependency on all FPC packages provided on your
 architecture. Experienced users may want to install only packages they need,
 and can skip installing this metapackage.
