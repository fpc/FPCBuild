Description: Free Pascal - SDK${PACKAGESUFFIX} suite
 The Free Pascal Compiler is an Object Pascal compiler supporting both Delphi
 and Turbo Pascal 7.0 dialects, as well as Mac Pascal dialects. It provides a
 completely portable RunTime Library (RTL) available on many platforms and
 compatible with Turbo Pascal, along with a platform-independent class-based
 Free Component Library (FCL) adding many Delphi extensions and interfacing
 with many popular open source libraries.
 .
 Extensions have been added to the language, such as function overloading,
 creation and linking of shared libraries, and Delphi language extensions
 including classes, exceptions, ANSI strings, and open arrays.
 .
 This metapackage pulls in all the FPC packages provided for this
 architecture. Experienced users may instead prefer to install the particular
 packages they require by hand.
