  [Abou Al Montacir]
  * Added a new directive, CFGDIR, to configuration file allowing one to add a
    directory to a list where included configuration files are searched.
  * Define a default location, multi-arch compatible, for third party units,
    which should be installed in /usr/lib/$fpctarget-gnu/fp-units-2.6.2/$pkg/.
    Each fp-units package should install a configuration file called $pkg.cfg

  * Use compiler configuration file to pass debian custom compilaer flags.
  * Pass "-z relro" to linker to remove lintian error.

  [Peter Michael Green]
  * Use "FPMAKE_SKIP_CONFIG" rather than "FPCFPMAKE" to pass linker option
    needed for building fpmake. This method unlike the previous one shouldn't
    break crossbuilding.  (though I don't know if crossbuilding works in
    general)

    versions of patch.

    "Pascal compiler" (pc) from Makefile(s) (Closes:#76615).
