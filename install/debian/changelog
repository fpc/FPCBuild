  [Abou Al Montacir]
  * Added a new directive, CFGDIR, to configuration file allowing one to add a

  * Define a default location, multi-arch compatible, for third party units,
    which should be installed in /usr/lib/$fpctarget-gnu/fp-units-2.6.2/$pkg/.
    Each fp-units package should install a configuration file called $pkg.cfg

    general)
