Description: Should I rename "/etc/fpc.cfg" to "/etc/fpc.cfg.bak"?
 FPC supports now multiple version installations. This allows co-existence of
 multiple versions on the same system. The default version can be selected using
 the update-alternatives command for the following groups:
     1)fpc      : compiler default version
     2)fpc.cfg  : configuration file default version
     3)fp-utils : helper tools default version
 .
 What ever version you may choose as default, the configuration files (2) are
 always backward compatible and it may be very safe to use the latest version
 for it.
 .
 In order to use alternatives system I need to rename the fpc.cfg configuration file.
