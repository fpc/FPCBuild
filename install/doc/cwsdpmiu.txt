This is an update of the r5 distribution for testing purposes.  It is a test
version!  The copyright banner has an updated year but the images are very
similar to the standard r5 binaries.  Three bug fixes:

1) Test of PSE feature checks correct bit (removes warnings with BOCHS).
2) Load ESP properly to clear upper bits with VCPI servers setting them
   (Martin, please test!)
3) Serializing jump to avoid Pentium III bug hang (Symantec bug).

Official r5 version is included as CWSDPMI5.EXE and CWSDSTB5.EXE in case of
troubles with particular configuration. However, the test version is 4 years
old now, so it should be hopefully safe.
