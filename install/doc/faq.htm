<h3>What is Free Pascal (FPC)?</h3>
<p>Originally named FPK-Pascal, the Free Pascal compiler is a 32
bit Turbo Pascal and Delphi compatible Pascal compiler for DOS,
Linux, Win32, OS/2, FreeBSD, AmigaOS, MacOSX, MacOS classic and
several other platforms (the number of supported targets grows
all the time, although not all of them are on the same level as
the main ones).</p>
	
<p>The Free Pascal compiler is available for several
architectures, x86, Sparc (v8,v9), ARM, x86&nbsp;64 (AMD64/Opteron)
and Powerpc. An older version (the 1.0 series) also supports
m68k.</p>
	
<p>The compiler is written in Pascal and is able to compile its
own sources. The source files are under GPL and included.</p>
<p> Free Pascal is modest regarding its minimal system
requirements (386-25 Mhz for the Intel version and ideally a
68020 processor for the Motorola version. FPU emulation required).
At least 2 megabytes of RAM are required. To remake the compiler
more than 32-64MB is recommended, less for 1.0.x versions. </p>
<p>Short history:
<ul>
<li>06/1993: project start</li>
<li>10/1993: first little programs work</li>
<li>03/1995: the compiler compiles the own sources</li>
<li>03/1996: released to the internet</li>
<li>07/2000: 1.0 version</li>
<li>12/2000: 1.0.4 version</li>
<li>04/2002: 1.0.6 version</li>
<li>07/2003: 1.0.10 version</li>
<li>05/2005: 2.0 </li>	
</ul>
</p>
<li><a name=versions></a>
<h3>Which versions exist, and which one should I use?</h3>
<p>The latest official version is 2.0.4, released as a bug fix release for
2.0.x series. New development is performed in 2.1.x series, which eventually
gets released as either 2.2.0, or 3.0.0 (depending on amount of accumulated
changes at the time of release).</p>
<h4>Historic versions</h4>
<p>FPC's version numbering changed a few times over the years. Versions
before 0.99.5 are considered archaic. After the release of 0.99.5 a
system in version numbering was introduced, and that system was changed
slightly changed after the 1.0 release. </p>
<p><b>Versioning for versions 0.99.5 - 1.0</b></p>
<p>Compilers with an <b>even</b> last number are <b>release</b>
versions (e.g. 0.99.8, 0.99.10, 0.99.12, 0.99.14 1.0.0)<br>Compilers and
packages with an <b>odd</b> last number are <b>development</b> versions
(e.g. 0.99.9, 0.99.11, 0.99.13, 0.99.15) </p>
<p>0.99.5 is an exception to this rule, since <b>0.99.5 IS a release</b>
(a release prior to the introduction of this odd/even system).</p>
<p>Letters behind the version number (0.99.12b, 0.99.5d) indicate
release versions with some bugs and problems in the original release
(respectively 0.99.12 and 0.99.5) fixed.</p>
<p><b>Versioning after 1.0</b></p>
<p>Together with the release of 1.0 the version numbering was
slightly changed, and a system in versioning resembling the Linux
kernel's has been introduced. The main difference is that the difference
between a release version is now in the second number (1.0.x vs 1.1.x)
instead of the third number (0.99.14 vs 0.99.15), and the third number
now becomes the patch level, replacing the postfixed letter in the old
system. </p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Releases that only fixed bugs in version 1.0 were numbered 1.0.x.</li>
<li>New development (the so called snapshots) started with version number
1.1.x.</li>
<li>Eventually the 1.1.x versions, when stabilized turned to 2.x. Fixes on
2.0 release are numbered 2.0.x.</li>
<li>The new development after the 2.0 release is numbered 2.1.x
and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Normally you would want to use a release. Releases are considered
stable, and easier to support (the bugs, quirks and unintended
"features" are well known after a period of time, and workarounds
exist).</p>
<p>Development snapshots (which are generated daily) reflect the current
status of the compiler. Development versions probably have new features
and larger bugs fixed since the last release, but might have some
temporary stability drawbacks (which are usually fixed by the next day).</p>
<p>Development snapshots are often quite useful for certain categories of
users. Ask in the maillists if it is worth the trouble in your case if
you're not sure.</p>
<p>We advise all users to upgrade to the newest version for their
target (Preferably the stable 2.0.x series).</p>

<h3>Free Pascal and GNU Pascal - a comparison</h3>
<DL>
<DT><b>Aim:</b>
<DD>Free Pascal tries to implement a Borland compatible pascal
compiler on as many platforms as possible. GNU Pascal tries to
implement a portable pascal compiler based on POSIX.
<DT><b>Version:</b>
<DD>Currently, Free Pascal is at version 2.0 (may 2005). GNU Pascal is at
version 2.1 (from 2002, which can be built with several different GCC's as backend; 
their Mac OS X version is an exception though, as it follows the GCC version number).
<DT><b>Tracking:</b>
<DD>Between releases, development versions of FPC are available through daily snapshots
and the source via CVS. GPC issues a set of patches to the last version a few times 
a year, and there are regular snapshot for OS X and Windows, made by users.
<DT><b>Operating systems:</b>
<DD>Free Pascal runs on a large amount of platforms of OSes,
e.g. DOS, Win32 (no Unix porting layer needed), Linux, FreeBSD,
NetBSD, OS/2, BeOS, Classic Mac OS, Mac OS X, and AmigaOS, on,  at
the moment the following architectures: x86,
x86&nbsp;64 (AMD64), Sparc, PowerPC, ARM and Motorola (Motorola only in version 1.0.x).
GNU Pascal runs basically on any system that can run GNU C, and for which the buildprocess was verified.
<DT><b>Bootstrapping:</b>
<DD>FPC requires a suitable set of binutils (AS,AR,LD), gmake and a commandline compiler. New architectures/OSes are crosscompiled.
GPC bootstraps via a suitable version of GCC, and requires a full set of binutils, flex, bison, gmake, a POSIX shell and libtool 
<DT><b>Sources:</b>
<DD>Free Pascal is entirely written in Pascal (about 6 MB of source
code), while GNU Pascal is written in C (it's an adaptation of the GNU
C compiler: 2.8 MB code + 8 MB of GNU C code)
<DT><b>Language:</b>
<DD>Free Pascal supports the Borland Pascal dialect, 
implements the Delphi Object Pascal language and has some Mac Pascal extensions.
GNU Pascal supports ISO 7185, ISO 10206, (most of) Borland Pascal 7.0
<DT><b>Extensions:</b>
<DD>Free Pascal implements method, function and operator overloading. (later Delphi versions add these, so strictly not an extension anymore)
GNU Pascal implements operator overloading.
<DT><b>License:</b>
<DD>Both compilers come under the GNU GPL.
<DT><b>Author:</b>
<DD>Free Pascal was started by Florian Klaempfl, Germany
(florian&#x040;freepascal.org), GNU Pascal was started by Jukka Virtanen,
Finland (jtv&#x040;hut.fi). </DD></DL><br>
<li><a name=general-license></a>
<h3>License and copyright information</h3>
<p> Applications created by the compiler and using the runtime
library come under a modified library gnu public license (LGPL),
which permit no restriction on the type of license the application
has. It is therefore possible to create closed source
or proprietary software using Free Pascal.
</p>
<p>This extra exception to the LGPL is added:<br><I> As a special
exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
permission to link this library with independent modules to
produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of
these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the
resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided
that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the
terms and conditions of the license of that module. An
independent module is a module which is not derived from or
based on this library. If you modify this library, you may
extend this exception to your version of the library, but
you not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so,
delete this exception statement from your version.</I></p>
Please note that you still have to comply to the LGPL, which, for example,
requires you to provide the source code of the runtime library. If you want
to write proprietary closed source software, please do this to comply:
<ul>
<li>Most people can satisfy the source code requirement by mentioning
the rtl source code can be downloaded at the Free Pascal
web site: if you did not modify the rtl this is considered adequate to
satisfy the LGPL requirement of providing source code.
<li>If you made modifications to the runtime library, you cannot keep them
for yourself, you must make them available if requested.
<li>Distribute the LGPL license with your product.
</ul>
<p> The compiler source code, on the other hand, comes under
the GNU Public license, which means that any usage of the compiler
source can only be used in software projects which have the same
license. </p>

<h3>Getting the compiler</h3>
<p>The latest official stable Free Pascal release is available for download
from one of our <a href="http://www.freepascal.org/download.html">official mirrors
</a></p>
<li><a name=general-install></a>
<h3>Free Pascal installation hints</h3>
<ul>
<li> Do not install the compiler in a directory which contains spaces
in its name, since some of the compiler tools do not like these </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><a name=ftpproblems></a>
<h3> Why do i have to supply a user name and password to get Free Pascal ? </h3>
<p> You are trying to login in to an ftp site. You must use the login name:
anonymous and as your password, you should put your e-mail address.
</p>
</li>
<li><a name=general-connectftp></a>
<h3>Access denied error when connecting to the Free Pascal FTP site</h3>
<p>The Free Pascal main ftp site can only accept a maximum number of
simultaneous connections. If this error occurs, it is because
this limit has been reached. The solution is either to wait and
retry later, or better still use one of the Free Pascal mirror sites.</p>
</li>
<li><a name=ideinst></a>
<h3>Where can I find a text mode IDE?</h3>
<p>The development of the IDE (integrated development environment) is
not yet finished. However a working test version of the IDE is included
with version 1.0.x and higher of the compiler. There might be problems
running the DOS IDE under Windows NT and Windows 2000 (especially
the debugger), in that case it is suggested to use the native Windows
version. </p>
<p> The textmode IDE on *nix targets has several terminal problems. Try
to use a real xterm as possible, and choose a font which has a Dos
character set
</p>
</li>
<li><a name=snapshot></a>
<h3>I want a new version NOW</h3>
<p>In the time between the release of new official versions, you can
have a look at and test developer versions (so-called "snapshots"). Be
warned though: this is work under progress, so in addition to old bugs
fixed and new features added, this may also contain new bugs. </p>
<p>Snapshots are generated automatically each night from the current
source at that moment. Sometimes this may fail due to bigger changes not
yet fully implemented. If your version doesn't work, try again one or
two days later. You're advised not to download the GO32v1 version for
Dos, since it's not supported any more. </p>
<p>The latest snapshot can always be downloaded from the <A
href="http://www.freepascal.org/develop.html#snapshot">development</a>
web page. </p>
</li>
<li><a name=installsnap></a>
<h3>Installing a snapshot</h3>
<p>To install a snapshot, extract the zip archive into the existing
program directory of the last official version of Free Pascal (after
making a backup of the original of course). You can also extract it into
an empty directory and then move the files to the program directory,
overwriting existing files. </p>
<p> Make sure that you extract the ZIP archive such that the included
directory structure remains intact. For example if you use PKUNZIP,
use "pkunzip -d" instead of just "pkunzip". Note that snapshots also
contain a new RTL which most likely can't be used with the previous
release version, so backup your old RTL as well. </p>
</li>
<li><a name=KnownBugs></a>
<h3>Known bugs / Reporting bugs</h3>
<p>Go to the <a href="http://www.freepascal.org/bugs.html">bugs page</a>. </p>
<p>If you wish to know the bugs for a specific Free Pascal version, go to the bugs
page, display the bug database. At the end of the page you should
see an option to view only specific bugs. Choose "With Version"
with the version you want to get information about and
"With Status" choose "Unfixed". This should display all bugs
which are present in the specific version of the compiler
you requested.
</p>
</li>
<li><a name=HOMEWORK></a>
<h3>I have to write a program for homework. Can you help?</h3>
<p>No. Please, don't send us mail about homework, we are no teachers.
The Free Pascal development team tries to give good support for the Free
Pascal compiler and are trying to always reply to emails. If we get
emails like this, this becomes harder and harder. </p>
</li>
<li><a name="windowsapp"></a>
<h3>How do I make a real Windows application with windows and menu bars?</h3>
The easiest way is to <a href='http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org'>download Lazarus</a>.
It won't be just a Windows application, it will also work under Linux, FreeBSD and
MacOS X.
</li>
<li><a name="game"></a>
<h3>How do I make a game with Free Pascal? Can I make a game like Doom 3?</h3>
Yes, you can make games with Free Pascal and if you are really good you can make
a game like Doom 3. Making games is difficult, you need to be an experienced
programmer to make them. The web site <a href='http://www.pascalgamedevelopment.com'>
www.pascalgamedevelopment.com</a> is a community of people who program games in Free
Pascal and Delphi.
<p>
If you want a start, please start to study <a href='http://www.delphi-jedi.org/Jedi:TEAM&nbsp;SDL&nbsp;HOME'>JEDI-SDL</a>
or <a href='http://ptcpas.sourceforge.net'>PTCPas</a>. Also you can try to study an existing game, for example
<a href='http://thesheepkiller.sourceforge.net'>The Sheep Killer</a> is a very simple game and it should not be
very hard to understand its code.
</li>
<li><a name=ErrorPos></a>
<h3>Getting more information when an application crashes</h3>
<OL>
<li>The easiest possibility is to recompile your program with -gl
debugging option. This way unit LineInfo is automatically linked in,
and the printout after a program crash then contains source line
numbers in addition to addresses of the crash. To see runtime library (RTL)
functions in the backtrace with their real name, you have to recompile
the RTL with -gl too.</li>
<li>For more comprehensive checking, compile the
program with debugging information (use the -g command line option) </li>
<li>Load the program in the debugger <PRE>gdb(pas)(w) --directory=&lt;src dirs&gt; myprog.exe</PRE>Notes:
<ul>
<li>Under UNIX systems (Linux, the BSD's), don't add the ".exe" after myprog
<li>"<TT>src dirs</TT>" is a list of directories containing the
source code files of myprog and the units it uses seperated by
semi-colons (";"). The current directory is automatically included.</li>
</ul>
<li>Once inside the debugger, you can (optionally) set the command
line options that will be passed to your program using the command
"<TT>set args &lt;option1 option2 ...&gt;</TT>"
<li>To start the program, type "<TT>run</TT>" and press enter
<li>After the program has crashed, the address of the instruction
where the crash occurred will be shown. The debugger will try to
display the source code line corresponding with this address. Note
that this can be inside a procedure of the RTL, so the source may not
always be available and most likely the RTL wasn't compiled with
debugging information.
<li>If you then type "<TT>bt</TT>" (BackTrace), the addreses in the
call stack will be shown (the addresses of the procedures which were
called before the program got to the current address). You can see
which source code lines these present using the command
<PRE>info line *&lt;address&gt;</PRE>For example:<PRE>info line *0x05bd8</PRE></li>
</OL>
<li><a name=general-heap></a>
<h3>Increasing the heap size</h3>
<p>By default Free Pascal allocates a small part of RAM for your
application as heap memory. If it just allocated all it could get,
people running Windows would have problems as Windows would increase
the swap file size to give the program more memory on and on, until
the swap file drive would be full. </p>
<p>You can specify the size of the heap with -Chxxxx. </p>
<p>However, the heap size doesn't really matter, since the Heap
is able to grow: if you've used all the available heap space, the
program will try to get more memory from the Operating system (OS),
so the heap is limited to the maximum amount of free memory provided by
the OS. </p>
<p>It is only handy if you know you will need at least a certain amount
of memory. You can then specify this value using the -Ch parameter, so
your program will allocate it at once on startup. This is slightly
faster than growing the heap a number of times. </p>
</li>
<li><a name=general-doesntfindfiles></a>
<h3>Compiler seems to skip files in directories that -Fu points to</h3>
<p>This sometimes happens with installation/compilation scripts if the
copying command doesn't preserve dates. The object files get older than
the PPU file, and the compiler tries to recompile them. A simple <TT>touch</TT>
will solve it. </p>
<p>
Also note that FPC, contrary to Turbo Pascal keeps track of includefiles. Modified
includefiles or duplicate names might trigger an attempt at recompiling</p>

<h3>Why are the generated binaries so big?</h3>
<p>There are several reasons and remedies for this: </p>
<p>
<OL>
<li>
<p>You can create smartlinked applications. To turn on
the generation of smartlinkable units, use the -Cx command
line option when compiling your units. To turn on
the linking of previously generated smarlinkable units, use the -XX
(-XS in 0.99.12 and earlier) command line option when compiling a
program. </p>
<li>Normally, all symbol information is included in the resulting
program (for easier debugging). You can remove this by using the -Xs
command line option when compiling your program (it won't do anything
when compiling units)
<li>You can use UPX to pack the .EXEs (just like e.g. pklite) for Dos
(GO32v2) and Windows targets. Look <A
href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/">here</a> for
more info.
<li>You can use LXLITE for packing EMX binaries, but you won't be able
to run them under DOS (with extender) any more then. This issues is
not relevant for native OS/2 binaries compiled for target OS2 with
version 1.9.x and above, because these don't run under DOS anyway.
In addition, it might not be possible to use compressed binaries
on lower OS/2 versions (like 2.x) depending on chosen type of
compression. LXLITE can be found e.g. on
<a href="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/">Hobbes</a>, search for LXLITE.
<li>Turn on optimalisations, both for supplied packages (RTL, FV, FCL)
and for your own code, this will also decrease the code size. </li>
<li>Keep in mind that under NT,2000,XP, compressed binaries startup	
relatively slow. Test under various conditions (OS, CPU speed, memory)
if the behaviour is acceptable before compressing</li>

<h3>Configuration file problems (fpc.cfg or ppc386.cfg)</h3>
<p> Starting from version 1.0.6 of Free Pascal, the configuration
file is now called <TT>fpc.cfg</TT> instead of <TT>ppc386.cfg</TT>.
For backward compatibility , <TT>ppc386.cfg</TT> is still searched first
and, if found, is used instead of <TT>fpc.cfg</TT></p>
<p> Versions prior to Free Pascal 1.0.6 do not recognize <TT>fpc.cfg</TT>,
so if you wish to use an earlier version of the compiler using the
same configuration file used with FPC version 1.0.6 (or later),
the configuration file should be renamed to <TT>ppc386.cfg</TT></p>.

<h3>Runtime errors</h3>
<p> When there is abnormal termination of an application generated
by Free Pascal, it is very probable that a runtime error will be
generated. These errors have the form : </p>

Runtime error 201 at 0x00010F86
0x00010F86  main,  line 7 of testr.pas
0x0000206D
</PRE>
<p> The 201 in this case indicates the runtime error
number. The definition of the different runtime error numbers is
described in the Free Pascal user's manual, Appendix D. The
hexadecimal numbers represent the call stack when the error occured.

<h3>Debugging smartlinked code does not fully work</h3>
<p>Debugging smart linked code might not work correctly. This is
due to the fact that no type information is emitted for
smartlinked code. If this would not be done, the files
would become enormous.

<p> While debugging, it is not recommended to use the
smartlinking option.</p>

<h3>PPU files binary compatibility between versions</h3>
<h3>Can't compile a program using a binary only version of a unit</h3>
<p>
Sometimes, even though there is a binary version of a module (unit file and object file)
available, the compiler still gives compilation errors. This can be caused either by an
incompatibility in the PPU file format (which should change only between
major versions of the compiler), or by a change in one of the units of the RTL
which has changed in between releases.
</p>
<p>
To get more information, compile the code using the -va (show all information)
compiler switch, and the unit loading phase will be displayed. You might
discover that the unit being loaded requires to be recompiled because one
of the unit it uses has changed.
</p>
<p>So if you plan on distributing a module without the source code, the binaries
should be compiled and made available for all versions of the compiler you
wish to support, otherwise compilation errors are bound to occur.
</p>
<p>In other words, the unit (PPU) file format does not change significantly
in between minor releases of the compiler (for exemple : from 1.0.4 and 1.0.6)
which means they are binary compatible, but because the interface of the units
of the RTL certainly changes between versions, recompilation will be required
for each version anyways.

<h3>File denied errors when opening files with reset </h3>
<p> Trying to open files using <CODE>reset</CODE> on non-text files
might cause a Runtime Error 5 (Access denied). </p>
<p> All files opened using the above system unit routine use the current
<CODE>filemode</CODE> value to determine how the file is opened. By
default, <CODE>filemode</CODE> is set to 2 (Read/Write access).
</p>
<p>So, a call to <CODE>reset</CODE> on non-text files does <EM>not</EM>
indicate that the file will be opened read-only. So, trying to open a file
using <CODE>reset</CODE> with the defaults will fail on read-only files.
<CODE>filemode</CODE> should be set to 0 (Real-only access) before
calling <CODE>reset</CODE> to solve this problem. A sample solution
is shown below.
</p>
<PRE>
const
{ possible values for filemode }
READ&#95;ONLY = 0;
WRITE&#95;ONLY = 1;
READ&#95;WRITE = 2;
var
oldfilemode : byte;
f: file;
begin
assign(f,'myfile.txt');
oldfilemode := filemode;
{ reset will open read-only }
filemode := READ&#95;ONLY;
reset(f,1);
{ restore file mode value }
filemode := oldfilemode;
// ...
close(f);
end.

<h3>What about .NET? </h3>
Occasionally, users ask about a FPC that supports .NET, or our
plans in that direction. <p>
Mainly the users are either interested because of .NET's
portability aspects (Mono is quoted over and over again), or
because it is supposed to be the next big thing in Windows
programming.<p>
While the FPC core developpers are somewhat interested out of
academic curiousity (mainly because it could be a pilot for
creating bytecode) there are however several problems with .NET
in combination with FPC:
	
<OL> 
<li>FPC's language uses pointers, and so can only be
unmanaged. Unmanaged code is not portable under .NET, so that
already kills all possible benefits. This also means that
existing FPC and Delphi code won't run on .NET.</li>
<li>FPC's libraries don't base on .NET classes and datamodels (and
can't be changed to do so without effectively rewriting them),
moreover the libraries could only be unmanaged too, or they
would be incompatible</li>
<li>There is nothing <emph>practical</emph> known yet about how
portable an average .NET code will be. Little experiments with
hello world level code mean nothing, that kind of code works
with plain C too. </li>
<li>Operating System dependant code wouldn't work anymore, since
the win32 interface is unmanaged.</li> 
</OL> <p>
 
So effectively this means that for FPC to benefit from .NET you
would have to significantly adapt the language (thus compiler) and
libraries, and be incompatible with the existing native sourcecode.
This is not adding support for .NET in FPC, but reimplementing FPC
on .NET from near scratch without backwards compability. Moreover
that also means that existing apps would have to be rewritten for
.NET, since it would take more than a simple recompile with a
FPC/.NET compiler.<p>
While unmanaged code has some uses (allows to integrate with managed
code inside windows easier), this still needs a codegenerator
backend to be written, interfaces and libraries defined, for little
practical use. This means a <b>lot of work</b> and since .NET take
up is not really high, this might not be worth it, since an
unmanaged FPC/.NET would only be minimally used. <p>
However if a FPC user does the bulk of the work (e.g. a bytecode
codegenerator, and maybe some base libraries) and if the work is
suitable for inclusion in FPC (a very big if), we will of course
include it.<p>
These problems are pretty much similar for the Java (bytecode) too. 
One has to mutilate the language, and rewrite the libraries from
scratch on the base libraries of the target (Java/.NET). Such an
attempt would have little synergy with the FPC project as it is
today.<p>

<h3>Considerations in porting to other processors</h3>
<p>Because the compiler now supports processors other than the Intel, it
is important to take a few precautions so that your code will execute
correctly on all processors. </p>
<ul>
<li>Limit your use of asm statements unless it is time critical code</li>
<li>Try not to rely on the endian of the specific machines when doing
arithmetic operations. Furthermore, reading and writing of binary data
to/from files will probably require byte swaps across different endian
machines (swap is your friend in this case). This is even more
important if you write binary data to files. Freepascal defines 
<CODE>ENDIAN&#x5F;LITTLE</CODE> or <CODE>ENDIAN&#x5F;BIG</CODE> to indicate the
target endian. </li>
<li>Try limiting your local variables in subroutines to 32K, as this
is the limit of some processors, use dynamic allocation instead.
<li>Try limiting the size of parameters passed to subroutines to 32K,
as this is the limit of some processors, use const or var parameters
instead. </li>
<li>The <TT>integer</TT> and <TT>cardinal</TT> types might have different
sizes and ranges on each processor, as well as depending on the compiler
mode.
</li>
<li>The <TT>CPU32</TT> or <TT>CPU64</TT> (defined by FPC starting 
from version 1.9.3) are defined indicating if the target is a 32-bit or 
64-bit cpu; This can help you separate 32-bit and 64-bit specific code. 
</li>
<li>Use the <TT>ptrint</TT> type (defined by FPC starting 
from version 1.9.3) when declaring an ordinal that will store
a pointer, since pointers can be either 32-bit or 64-bit depending on
the processor and operating system. 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p></p>
<li><a name=PortingOS></a>
<h3>Considerations in porting code to other operating systems</h3>
<p>Because the compiler supports several different operating systems,
is important to take a few precautions so that your code will execute
correctly on all systems. </p>
<ul>
<li>File sharing is implemented differently on different operating
systems, so opening already opened files may fail on some operating
systems (such as Windows). The only correct way to make sure to
have the same file sharing behavior is to use the I/O routines
furnished in <TT>sysutils</TT>. </li>
<li>Clean up at the end of your program, i.e. close all files on exit, and
release all allocated heap memory, as some operating systems don't like it
when some things are left allocated or opened.</li>
<li> Some operating systems limit the local stack space which can be allocated,
therefore it is important to limit subroutine nesting, and the amount of
local variables. Limiting total stack space usage at a given moment to
at most 256 KBytes while make porting easier.</li>
<li> Do not hard code paths to files, try to use relative paths
instead </li>
<li> Use the following constants (defined in the system unit)
to get information on files, line endings, and to build paths:
<ul>
<li> <TT>LineEnding</TT> : Indicates the characters which end a text line</li>
<li> <TT>LFNSupport</TT> : Indicates if long filenames are supported (more then 8.3 characters)</li>
<li> <TT>DirectorySeparator</TT> : The character or characters which separate path components </li>
<li> <TT>DriveSeparator</TT> : The character which separate the drive specification from the rest
of the path</li>
<li> <TT>PathSeparator</TT> : The character which separates directories in the search path environment</li>
<li> <TT>FileNameCaseSensitive</TT> : Boolean indicating if the filenames for this system are case-sensitive or not</li>
</ul>
It is also possible to use the <TT>PathDelim</TT>, <TT>PathSep</TT> and <TT>DriveDelim</TT> constants
defined in <TT>sysutils</TT>.

<h3>Compiling Delphi code using Free Pascal</h3>

list of Delphi incompabilities also check the manual. </p>
</li>
<li><a name=HowcanIbuildaunit></a>
<h3>Building a unit</h3>
<p>It works like in Turbo Pascal. The first keyword in the file must be
UNIT (not case sensitive). The compiler will generate two files:
<TT>XXX.PPU</TT> and <TT>XXX.O</TT>. The PPU file contains the interface
information for the compiler and the O-file the machine code (an object
file, whose precise structure depends on the assembler you used). To use
this unit in another unit or program, you must include its name in the
USES clause of your program. </p>
</li>
<li><a name=CompileSystemUnit></a>
<h3>Compiling the system unit</h3>
<p>To recompile the system unit, it is recommended to have GNU make
installed. typing 'make' in the rtl source directory will then recompile
all RTL units including the system unit. You may choose to descend into
the directory of your OS (e.g. rtl/go32v2) and do a 'make' there. </p>
<p>It is possible to do all this manually, but you need more detailed
knowledge of the RTL tree structure for that. </p>
</li>
<li><a name=Howdoesfunctionoverloadingwork></a>
<h3>How does function overloading work?</h3>
<p>function overloading is implemented, like in C++:

procedure a(i : integer);
begin
end;
procedure a(s : string);
begin
end;
begin
a('asdfdasf');
a(1234);
end.
</PRE>
<p>You must be careful. If one of your overloaded functions is in the
interface part of your unit, then all overloaded functions must be in
the interface part. If you leave one out, the compiler will complain
with a 'This overloaded function can't be local' message. Overloaded
functions must differ in their parameters, it's not enough if their
return types are different. </p>

assembly syntax. See the documentation for more info on how to use
different assembler styles. </p>
<p>A description of the AT&amp;T syntax can be found in the GNU
Assembler documentation. </p>

<li><a name=systemnotfound></a>
<h3>Unit system, syslinux, sysos2 or syswin32 not found errors</h3>
<p>System (syslinux - not the bootloader, sysos2 or syswin32, depending
on platform) is Pascal's base unit which is implicitely used in all programs.
This unit defines several standard procedures and structures, and must be found to
be able to compile any pascal program by FPC. </p>
<p>The location of the system.ppu and syslinux.o files are determined by
the -Fu switch which can be specified commandline, but is usually in the
ppc386.cfg or fpc.cfg configuration file. </p>
<p>If the compiler can't find this unit there are three possible causes:</p>
<OL>
<li>The ppc386.cfg or fpc.cfg isn't in the same path as the compiler
executable (go32v2, win32 and OS/2) or can't be found as
"/etc/fpc.cfg" or ".fpc.cfg" in your homedirectory (Linux).
<li>The fpc.cfg or ppc386.cfg doesn't contain the -Fu line, or a wrong one.
See the <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~marcov/buildfaq.pdf">build faq (PDF)</a>, especially the chapters
about the fpc.cfg and the directory structure.
<li>The files ARE found but the wrong version or platform. Correct
ppc386.cfg or fpc.cfg to point to the right versions or reinstall the right
versions (this can happen if you try to use a <A
href="#snapshot">snapshot</a>
compiler while the -Fu statement in the used fpc.cfg still points to
the RTL that came with the official release compiler). </li>
</OL>
<p>A handy trick can be executing "ppc386 programname -vt", this shows
where the compiler is currently looking for the system unit's files. You
might want to pipe this through more (Dos, OS/2, Windows) or less
(Linux), since it can generate more than one screen information: </p>
<p>

<h3>There is a new extension that will be really useful. Will you include it?</h3>
<p>
Occasionally somebody asks for a new extension on the maillist,
and the discussions that follow have a recurring pattern. An
extension is quite a big deal for the FPC team, and there are
some criteria that are used to select if an extension is
&quot;worth&quot; the trouble. The most important pre-selection criteria are:
<OL>
<li>Compability must not be compromised in any way. Existing
codebases on at least the Pascal level must keep 
running. This is often more difficult than most people
think.</li>
<li>The extension must have real value.  Anything that is only
a shorter notation does not apply, unless it is 
out of compatibility with an existing Pascal/Delphi
codebase. Practically it means it must make something
possible that can't be done otherwise or be a compability
item </li>
<li>The change must fit in with the scope of the project, 
implementing a Pascal compiler which can have a RAD
and generic DB system. This excludes features like
inline SQL, and large garbage collected objectframeworks.
</li>
</OL>	
Exceptions to the second rule are sometimes made for platform
specific reasons (e.g. interfacing to some other language or
OS). The first rule is often a problem, because issues aren't
easily recognizable unless one has tried to make extensions
before. Best is to make a thoroughly written proposal that the
devels can review with
<ul><li> Explanation of the feature</li>
<li> Why it is needed, what does it make possible?</li>
<li> How you would implement it?</li>
<li> Lots of examples of typical use, and tests for possible problem
cases</li>
</ul>	
Try to be verbose and really try to view this from the viewpoint
of somebody who has to implement it, and try to make examples
that span multiple units and procedures, and review what happens.
Be critical, try to punch holes in your
own reasoning and find possible problematic cases, and document
them.	
</p> 
<p>
Besides these pre-selection rules and documentation, the other
important question is who is going to do the work. Keep in mind
that the FPC devels are volunteers with to-do lists that are
booked till the next decade. You can't simply expect they'll
drop everything from their hands and implement the feature
because you need it urgently, or think it is nice. If you are
not willing to implement it yourself, and submit patches,
chances are slim.  Remarks as &quot;this will attract a lot of
users because&quot; are considered with a lot of scepsis, since
that applies to any new development.

<h3>Using the graph unit with Free Pascal</h3>
<p>Since version 1.0, we  have a completely platform independent way
of selecting resolutions and bitdepths. You are strongly encouraged to
use it, because other ways will probably fail on one or other platform.
See the documentation of the graph unit for more information. </p>
</li>
<li><a name=WrongColors></a>
<h3>Why do I get wrong colors when using the graph unit?</h3>
<p>If you use <TT>detect</TT> as graphdriver, you will end up with the
highest supported bitdepth. Since the graph unit currently only supports
up to 16 bits per pixel modes and since this bitdepth is supported by
all graphics cards made in at least the last 5 years, you will most
likely get a 16 bit mode. </p>
<p>The main problem is that in 16 (and 15, 24, 32, ...) bit modes, the
colors aren't set anymore using an index in a palette (the palettized
way is called "indexed color"). In these modes, the color number itself
determines what color you get on screen and you can't change this color.
The color is encoded as follows (for most graphics cards on PC's at
least): </p>
<ul>
<li>15 bit color: lower 5 bits are blue intensity, next come 5 bits of
green and then 5 bits of red. The highest bit of the word is ignored.</li>
<li>16 bit color: lower 5 bits are blue intensite, next come *6* bits
of green and then 5 bits of red. </li>
</ul>
<p>This means that either you have to rewrite your program so it can
work with this so-called "direct color" scheme, or that you have to use
<TT>D8BIT</TT> as graphdriver and <TT>DetectMode</TT> as graphmode. This
will ensure that you end up with a 256 (indexed) color mode. If there
are no 256 color modes supported, then graphresult will contain the
value <TT>GrNotDetected</TT> after you called InitGraph and you can
retry with graphdriver <TT>D4BIT</TT>. Make sure you use the constant
names (D8BIT, D4BIT, ...) and not their actual numeric values, because
those values can change with the next release! That is the very reason why
such symbolic constants exist. </p>

<h3> File sharing and file locks </h3>

by another process or the same process. </p>
<p> Generally the behaviors for the different operating
systems are as follows : </p>
<ul>
<li> UNIX systems : There is no verification at all. </li>
<li> Windows : An access denied error will be reported. </li>
<li> Amiga : An access denied error will be reported. </li>
<li> DOS / OS/2 : If the file is opened more than once by
the same process, no errors will occur, otherwise an
access denied error will be reported. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are two ways to solve this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li> Use specific operating system calls (such as file locking
on UNIX and Amiga systems) to get the correct behavior. </li>
<li> Use the <TT>sysutils</TT> unit or the Free Component Library

<p>Since version 0.99.8, the Port array is supported like in TP, as long
as you use the ports unit in your program (not available under Win32).</p>

<h3>Using OS/2 generated applications under DOS</h3>
<p>OS/2 applications (including the compiler) created with version 1.0.x
and before should work correctly under vanilla DOS, since they are based
on EMX (versions prior to 1.0.5 had big problems with EMX under DOS, this
is now fixed). It is important to note that the compiled applications
require the EMX runtime files (<TT>emx.exe</TT>) to execute properly. It may be
necessary to distribute these files with the generated application.</p>
<p>Binaries created for target OS2 with version 1.9.x and above cannot
run under DOS any more, because they directly use OS/2 API functions not
available when running under extender - you need to compile for a newly added
EMX target which provides this capability of running on both platforms.</p>

<h3> Graph and problems with keyboard, mouse and "dummy dos windows" </h3>
<p>Problem:
<ul>
<li>If you use the Graph unit under Win32, you can't use the API mouse
unit for mouse support or use the win32 Crt unit to get keyboard data.
The reason for this is that the window popped up is a GUI window, and
not a console one.</li>
</ul>
Solution:
<ul>
<li>Use units WinMouse and WinCrt instead.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Problem:
<ul>
<li>When you follow the above advice, and you run your purely Graph
based win32 program from the RUN menu in windows, a dummy dos window
is opened.</li>
</ul>
Solution:
<ul>
<li>Set the application type to GUI: <PRE>{$apptype GUI}</PRE>
and put this line before your programs InitGraph statement:
<PRE>ShowWindow(GetActiveWindow,0);
</PRE>This will hide the dos window window. </li>

<h3>Cygwin binary directory in your path sometimes causes strange problems</h3>
<p>The mingw make tool seems to look for a "sh.exe", which it
finds when the cygwin binary directory is in the path. The
way directories are searched changes, and the build process dies.
</p>
<p>Solution: don't put cygwin in your global path for now, only
add it when needed. Efforts are made to work around this.
</p>
<p>Possible untested workaround: add mingw sh.exe to a directory before 
the cygwin binary directory in the path

<h3>Makefile problems on Win2000 (and NT)</h3>
<p>After the 1.0.4 release, some problems with the mingw win32 build

has been released. Automatically building large parts of the sources under
Windows 2000 and Windows NT is now a lot easier. </p>

<h3>Using the DOS compiler under Windows 95</h3>
<p>There is a problem with the DOS (GO32V2) compiler and Windows 95 on
computers with less than 16 Megabytes of RAM. First set in the
properties of the DOS box the DPMI memory size to max value. Now try
to start a demo program in the DOS box, e.g. HELLO (starting may take
some time). If this works you will be able to get the compiler to work
by recompiling it with a smaller heap size, perhaps 2 or 4 MB
(option -Chxxxx). </p>

<h3>Using OS/2 generated applications under Windows</h3>

<a href="#dos-os2">note about running OS/2 applications under DOS</a> for
more detailed information. You need the RSX extender (rsx.exe) to do this.
There have been problems reported while trying to run EMX applications under
NT / 2000 / XP systems though. This seems to be a problem with EMX (RSX) itself.
It is not recommended to use Free Pascal OS/2 compiled programs under NT / 2000

<h3>Using DOS generated applications under windows</h3>
<p>Several problems have been found running DOS software

Therefore, even though the linux compiler target permits creating shared
libraries, the usage of that shared library may result in undefined
behavior, especially if accessing global variables in the library. Creation
of shared libraries is not recommended with the current version of the
compiler.

Importing code from shared libraries does work as expected though, since
it does not require usage of position independant code.

You are most probably using an older version of OS/2 (like OS/2 Warp 3.0)

of western and central Europe) line to your CONFIG.SYS, and restart OS/2.

was necessary to get support for features of modern CPUs). This version of the GNU tool
was created with Innotek port of GNU C and relies on its libc. This results in higher
limitations regarding supported configurations, because this libc needs recent version
of OS/2 Unicode support libraries (LIBUNI.DLL and UCONV.DLL) not available in base OS/2 Warp 3.0
and OS/2 Warp 4.0. The updated versions were distributed by IBM in corrective packages (fixpaks)
