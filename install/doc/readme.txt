                            Free Pascal Compiler

                               Version 2.0.4


****************************************************************************
* Introduction
****************************************************************************

Please also read the platform specific README file, if it exists.

This package contains a freeware 32-bit/64-bit pascal compiler for several
platforms. The language and the runtime library are almost compatible with
Turbo Pascal 7.0 and recent Delphi releases. There is also partial support
for the Macintosh pascal dialect.

Free Pascal 2.0.4 is currently available for the following platforms:
- Linux-i386
- Linux-x86_64 (amd64)
- Linux-arm (cross compiling environment for Linux-i386)
- Win32 (Win95/98/Me/XP/2000 and WinNT)
- OS/2-i386 (OS/2 Warp v3.0, 4.0, WarpServer for e-Business and eComStation)
- FreeBSD-i386
- Mac OS X/Darwin for PowerPC
- Linux-powerpc

The following platforms might be provided later:
- Mac OS (classic) for PowerPC
- Netware-i386
- NetwLibc-i386 (LibC is preferred API under newer Netware versions)
- Linux-sparc

There are other platforms which are more or less working, but there is
currently no maintainer for them and thus we cannot provide adequate
support. DOS (i386) using the GO32v2 dos extender is one such example,
other examples would include other BSD variants, etc. If you want to change
this and create and maintain versions for other platforms and targets, feel
free to contact us, e-mail addresses are listed below.

****************************************************************************
* Quick start - Win32
****************************************************************************

Download the distribution package (fpc-2.0.4.i386-win32.exe) and run it
- it is a self-extracting installer, so just follow the instructions
to install it. Don't forget to set the path as mentioned by the install
program.

To test the compiler, change to the demo directory of the compiler
and type
        fpc hello
        hello


****************************************************************************
* Quick start - OS/2 / DOS
****************************************************************************

Download distribution archive (os2204.zip for OS/2 or dos204.zip for
GO32v2) and unzip it into a temporary directory.

Start the install program INSTALL.EXE and follow the instructions.

Don't forget to set the path as mentioned by the install program.

To test the compiler, change to the demo directory of the compiler
and type
        fpc hello
        hello


****************************************************************************
* Quick start - Linux/FreeBSD
****************************************************************************

Download fpc-2.0.4.<cpu>-<os>.tar and untar into a temporary directory.

Start the install script with ./install.sh and follow the instructions.

To test the compiler, change to the demo directory of the compiler
and type
        fpc hello
        hello


****************************************************************************
* Documentation
****************************************************************************

The documentation is available as HTML pages, PDF, PS, and text although the
recommended format is pdf. These are all available on
ftp://ftp.freepascal.org/fpc/docs

NB that there is at present no FPC specific documentation for the Win32
system functions. There is a note in the ftp /doc explaining where
the MS help file for this can be obtained.

Suggestions, Help ...
---------------------
e-mail: fpc-devel@lists.freepascal.org (bugs, developer related questions)
e-mail: fpc-pascal@lists.freepascal.org (general pascal related questions)

Both these adresses are for mailing lists. If you're not subscribed,
be sure to mention this fact when sending questions to these lists,
so that people sending answers know about it and send you a copy.
Information about available lists and subscription can be found
on http://lists.freepascal.org/mailman/listinfo

WWW: http://www.freepascal.org
FTP: ftp://ftp.freepascal.org/fpc
(several mirrors exist, see website for links)

Additional information about mailing lists, news, future plans etc.
can be found on the web site.

SNAPSHOTS & SOURCES
-------------------
One of the features of FPC is the snapshots. These are made daily or weekly
from the developers' latest versions of the source. Snapshots are available
for GO32v2, Win32, OS/2, Linux and Netware versions. The latest snapshots
are in: ftp... /fpc/snapshot/ in appropriately named .zip/tar files.

You will also normally find in the snapshot archive file a readme, with
a note about the latest included changes. It is quite common, though it doesn't
always happen, that when a bug is reported it is fixed and a fixed version
can be obtained the NEXT day in the appropriate snapshot.... yes really!

Also on the ftp site you'll find a /dist directory, with the latest
distributed releases, a /docs directory, and a /source directory, in
which every night at about 0100 GMT the latest source generated by the
developers during the day & evening before is exported from CVS
into ZIP file fpc.zip.


Making your own snapshots
-------------------------
By downloading the /source files (makefiles are included)
it is possible to to make your own version of the fpc compiler/rtl
and to modify it. You are of course free to do this
so long as you observe the licence conditions. In order to make the
compiler/rtl & ides in a resonable time (eg <30 minutes) you'll need at least
32M of physical memory (64M is better) memory and at least a 200 Mhz processor
and at least 100 Mbytes of free disk space. You'll also need
some knowledge of making files & programming... it is not
difficult but it isn't easy either!

REPORTING BUGS
----------------
If you find a bug in the released version, you may want to try a snapshot
(see SNAPSHOTS above) to see if it has been fixed before reporting it to
the fpc-devel mailing list.

If you find a fault or 'feature' in a release, please report it either using
the bug reporting interface available on our WWW pages (see above), or to
the fpc-devel mailing list. PLEASE INCLUDE ALSO A COMPILABLE CODE FRAGMENT
which can be used to reproduce the problem (or a link to larger archive if
it cannot reproduced with small example), and state the version eg Win32,
GO32v2, and the date of the compiler etc on which you noticed the problem
& any other useful info so the developers can reproduce the problem,
otherwise they may not be willing/able to fix it.
